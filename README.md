This is an unofficial template for Amazon Research Award (ARA) proposals based on the official instruction in 2023.

1. For usage, see `ARA.tex`. 
2. To build, run `make` and the output is generated in the folder `out/`. 
3. The script `watch.sh` uses the file-change monitor `fswatch` to automatically invoke `make` when the tex file is changed.
4. The repo also has a GitHub workflow that compiles the pdf when pushing to GitHub, and the generated pdf can be found at the corresponding commit in the `Actions` tab of repository page on GitHub.
